*Whistle* is a toy programming language developed by [eliassjogren](https://github.com/eliassjogreen),
[loading...](https://github.com/load1n9) and [qu4k](https://github.com/qu4k).
It is mainly developed for the purpose of learning about the internals of programming
languages but also because it is fun to have created your own programming language.
Currently *Whistle* is in very early stages of development with no plans of becoming
a go-to language for any kind of serious project for the foreseeable future. This
will however not stop us from exploring it's limits to further develop *Whistle*
and hopefully one day make it a useable language.
